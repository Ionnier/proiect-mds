                <p> Project created for the laboratory of "Methods of Software Development".</p>
                <p> The aim of this project is to show that we are able to deliver an high quality application which
                    contains
                    all the basic elements of an modern application.</p>
                <p> As such I included the use of an MVC arhitecture using Sequelize as an ORM delivered in a Docker
                    container
                    for ease of deployment.</p>

                <p>Inspired by a very common problem, having to choose a certain activity with other people.</p>
                <p>Choosing an activity is an effective way of showing how you feel about something or about someone
                    else.</p>
                <p>As such, if the opinion of the other person is more important, you tend to let them choose. If you
                    meet someone with the same quality, then no one chooses. And this project aims to solve this
                    problem.</p>
                <p>By choosing randomly you can just do "everything"/"whatever".</p>
                <p>By choosing with some sort of currency you can use your "power" to take control of the choice.</p>
                <p>By being able to give this "power" to the other person you can still show this quality of making them
                    feel like the choice matters.</p>
                <p>And if they know, then the Universe remains with the same problems.</p>
